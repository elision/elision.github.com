## About

Elision is a term rewriting library and REPL.  It is *under construction*, so set your expectations accordingly.

The rewriter's initial feature set is stable, but the code itself is still undergoing testing.  The documentation is incomple
te and needs to be updated.  If you find problems, either with the rewriter or with the documentation, please check the [issu
e tracker][issues] and possibly file a new issue.
